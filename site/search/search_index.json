A common divisor of two integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is a positive integer \\(d\\) that divides both of them. The greatest common divisor of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is, as its name suggests, the largest positive integer \\(d\\) such that \\(d | a\\) and \\(d | b\\). The greatest common divisor of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is denoted gcd(a,b). If there is no possibility of confusion, it is also sometimes denoted by \\((a, b)\\). (If \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both \\(0\\), then \\(gcd(a, b)\\) is not defined.)</p> <p>Example 1.5.

In other words, the common divisors of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the same as the common divisors of \\(b\\) and \\(r\\); hence</p> <p> \\(gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r)\\) </p> <p>We repeat the process, dividing b by r to get another quotient and remainder, say</p> <p> \\(b=r\u00b7q + r \\quad with \\quad 0\u2264r'&lt;r\\) </p> <p>Then the same reasoning shows that</p> <p> \\(gcd(b, r) = gcd(r, r )\\) </p> <p>Continuing this process, the remainders become smaller and smaller, until eventually we get a remainder of \\(0\\), at which point the final value \\(gcd(s, 0) = s\\) is equal to the gcd of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).
