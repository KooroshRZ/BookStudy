A field is the general name for a (commutative) ring in which every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse. You are already familiar with some other fields, for example the field of real numbers \\(R\\), the field of rational numbers (fractions) \\(Q\\), and the field of complex numbers \\(C\\).</p> <p>The field \\(Z/pZ\\) of integers modulo \\(p\\) has only finitely many elements. It is a finite field and is often denoted by \\(F_p\\). Thus \\(F_p\\) and \\(Z/pZ\\) are really just two different notations for the same object. Similarly, we write \\({F_p}^p\\) interchangeably for the group of units \\((Z/pZ)^*\\). Finite fields are of fundamental importance throughout cryptography, and indeed throughout all of mathematics.</p> <p>Finite fields are also sometimes called Galois fields, after E \u0301variste Galois, who studied them in the nineteenth century. Yet another notation for \\(F_p\\) is \\(GF(p)\\), in honor of Galois. And yet one more notation for \\(F_p\\) that you may run across is \\(Z_p\\), although in number theory the notation \\(Z_p\\) is more commonly reserved for the ring of p-adic integers.</p>"}]}
